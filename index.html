                                    <p>The Existential Theory of Reals problem, often called ETR, is a computational problem where the goal is to determine if a formula \(\phi\), containing variables \(x_1, ..., x_n\) where \(x_i \in \mathbb{R}\ \forall\ i \in \{1, ..., n\}\) can be satisfied with a valuation of variables. The formula \(\phi\) is not only composed of real variables, but is also composed of logic operations and other mathematical symbols. In short, the alphabet of \(\phi\) is the following <a href="#art-gallery-er-1704.06969" refNumber="2" class="cite"><span class="page" page="4"></span></a> :</p>

The proof being long and non-trivial, it is not provided here.</p>

                                    <p>The Art Gallery Problem is at least as hard as deciding whether a system of equations and inequalities over \(\mathbb{R}\) has a satisfiable valuation <a href="#art-gallery-er-1704.06969" refNumber="2" class="cite"><span class="page" page="4"></span></a>.

                                        <p>Let \(\phi\) be an instance of ETR-INV. The polygon \(\mathcal{P}(\phi)\) has corners at rational coordinates, which can be computed in polynomial time.

                                    <p>In other words, there exists a reduction from ETR-INV to the Art Gallery Problem. Then we can establish the following :</p>

                                            Firstly, we know, from <a href="#art-gallery-er">Theorem 1 </a>, that the Art Gallery Problem belongs to \(\exists\mathbb{R}\). Furthermore, from <a href="#etr-inv-er-complete">Theorem 2</a>, we know that ETR-INV problem is \(\exists\mathbb{R}\)-complete. In other words, every other problem of \(\exists\mathbb{R}\) can be reduced to ETR-INV.
                                            <br />
                                            From <a href="#etr-reduction-art-gallery">Theorem 3</a>, we know there exists a reduction from ETR-INV to the Art Gallery Problem. Since ETR-INV is \(\exists\mathbb{R}\)-complete and that it can be transformed into an instance of the Art Gallery Problem, then the Art Gallery Problem is also \(\exists\mathbb{R}\)-complete.

                                        <p>Let \(P\) be a polygon with \(n\) vertices. Then, we can find a guard set \(G \subseteq P\) of cardinality at most \(\lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor\) <a href="#fisk" refNumber="8" class="cite"></a>.</p>

                                        <p class="proof">
                                            Let \(P\) be a polygon with \(n\) vertices.
                                            First, triangulate \(P\) without adding any new vertex. Every triangulation has a 3-colouring with colors \(a, b\) and \(c\). Now, we can define three subsets \(T_a, T_b, T_c\) of vertices of \(P\) where \(T_k\) is the set of vertices coloured with the colour \(k\). It is clear that at least one of the three subsets \(T_a, T_b, T_c\) has a cardinality \(\leq \lfloor\frac{n}{3}\rfloor\). Let us call that set \(T\). We know every point \(q\) of the polygon \(P\) is in one of the triangles and that every triangle has a point of $p$ of \(T\) on it. Since triangles are convex, we can deduce that \(pq \subset P\).

                                    <p>To compute the vibility polygon for a specific point \(a\), multiple algorithms with different techniques exist. The most common method is by using the circular sweeping method by sending rays from the point \(a\) to all the verticies \(V_i\) of the polygon \(P\). Then removing the rays which cross any edge of the polygon before reaching the corresponding vertex \(V_i\). And for the rays which can continue in the polygon after reaching the vertex \(V_i\), compute the next intersection with the polygon. At the end all the end point of the rays will form the boundaries of \(V(P,a)\).</p>
                                    <p>The algorithm implementend in the illustration 3 below, is based on the algorithm explained by Asano Tetsuo <a href="#visibility-polygon" refNumber="6" class="cite"><span class="page" page="557-559"></span></a>.

                                    <p>Firstly, we start with a basic rectangle of dimensions 4x20. Then, we will add a set \(T\) of six triangular "pockets" that we will call accordingly to their position in the polygon :</p>
                                    <ul>

                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Then, we will also add a set \(Q\) of 4 quadrilateral pockets that will have pretty much the same naming :</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>\(Q_{lt}\) (left-top)</li>
                                        <li>\(Q_{lb}\) (left-bottom)</li>

                                    <p>And finally, we add a set \(R\) of 3 small rectangular pockets (again, named using the same convention) :</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>\(R_{l}\) (left)</li>
                                        <li>\(R_{m}\) (middle)</li>

                                    <p>All the vertices are placed at specific places (= specific coordinates) for this polygon construction. We obtain the following polygon :</p>

                                    <p>It is clear that for the triangles \(T_{lt}\) and \(T_{lb}\) as well as for the triangles \(T_{rt}\) and \(T_{rb}\), we need a guard on a line connecting them to be sure that both they can be all seen by that guard.

                                    <p>After that, we need to ensure that the two triangles \(T_{mb}\) and \(T_{mt}\) are also completely seen. Again, we clearly understand that they can be seen by a guard only if that guard lays on the line \(l_m\) connecting them. At the end of the day, we get the polygon \(P\) with the lines \(l_l\), \(l_m\) and \(l_r\) as on the following figure :</p>

                                    <p>Now that we have taken in consideration the triangles of \(T\), we will concentrate our efforts on seeing the whole base rectangle as well as the 4 quadrilaterals of \(Q\). Let us start by studying the image on the left of the figure 9. If we fix the position of the guard on the line \(l\) in such a way that the guard (let us call it \(g_1\)) sees at least a portion of the bottom edge \(e_b\) and a portion of the edge \(e_t\), we can define \(p_b\) as the leftmost point on \(e_b\) that \(g_1\) can see. In a similar way, we define \(p_t\) as the leftmost point seen by \(g_1\) on the top edge \(e_t\). Clearly, if we move \(g_1\) upwards, \(p_b\) will move to the left while \(p_t\) will move to the right. The opposite happens when we move \(g_1\) downwards. Now, let us call \(b\) the bottom-right point of the quadrilateral \(Q_{lt}\) and \(d\) the top-right point of the quadrilateral \(Q_{rt}\). Then, we can create a line containing \(p_t\) and \(b\) and a second line containing \(p_b\) and \(d\). Those two lines will obviously intersect each other and we will call the intersection \(i\). It is clear that the triangle \(ibd\) is the triangle where we need to put a second guard \(g_2\) in order to see everything that remains that \(g_1\) can not see. If we repeat this for every possible position of \(g_1\) on the line \(l\), we obtain a curve that we will call \(C\). The guard \(g_2\) <span class="underline">must</span> be placed on the right of the line \(bd\) and on the left of the curve \(C\).</p>

                                    <p>Now, we can apply the same to the right part of the whole polygon \(P\) defined earlier. We get two curves \(c_l\) and \(c_r\) that defines the region where we could guard the whole polygon with 3 guards. </p>
                                    <p>A guard \(g_l\) must be on the line \(l_l\) to guard the triangular pockets \(T_{lt}\) and \(T_{lb}\) but that same guard must be placed at a correct Y-coordinate so that it can also guard the rectangle \(R_l\) that belongs to the polygon \(P\). We work on a similar way to obtain a guard \(g_r\) on the line \(l_r\). And finally, we want to have the last guard \(g_m\) on the line \(l_m\) to guard the two triangles \(T_{lb}\) and \(T_{rt}\), but also in the intersection formed by the two curves \(C_l\) and \(C_r\). Last but not least, we must also place \(g_m\) in such a way that it also sees the rectangle \(R_m\) :</p>

                                    <p>With a computation that will not be detailed here <a href="#irrational-1701.05475" refNumber="1" class="cite"><span class="page" page="12"></span></a> , we can determine that these 3 points exists but have irrational coordinates.</p>
                                    <p>Also, it is clear that if we scale the polygon \(P\) by the LCM of the denominators of the coordinates, we obtain a polygon having vertices with integer coordinates without changing the number of guards needed for the polygon. In conclusion, we have a polygon with vertices having integer coordinates that can be guarded by 3 irrational guards.</p>

                                    <p>It is easy to see that if we move slightly \(g_l\) and \(g_r\) on their line so that they have no more irrational coordinates, we can add a guard \(g_{m1}\) slightly to the left of \(g_m\) and a guard \(g_{m2}\) slightly to the right to correct the small portion of the polygon \(P\) that we do not see after moving \(g_l\) and \(g_r\). We can, of course, remove \(g_m\).</p>
                                    <p>We can see that the polygon \(P\) can be guarded by 3 irrational guards but can not be guarded by less than 4 guards if we can not use irrational coordinates for guards.</p>
